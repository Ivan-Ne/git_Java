Studying Java

In this task I created a class "Man" with private fields: name, age, height and position.
For class "Man" I added constructor and getters for private fields.
In the class "Main" string "s" is done for input. Here I also used methods: substring, parseInt and parseDouble.
As a result I got a column with useful info in readable view.

See the files Main and Man.
